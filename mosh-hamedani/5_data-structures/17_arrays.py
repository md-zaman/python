# Arrays are just like lists but take less space and performs a little bit faster
# But you have to note that you will only see the difference if you are dealing with a ver large number, maybe 1000 or more

#Use array only when you are dealing with a large sequence of numbers

from array import array # To use array, we have to import array from a module and it's class arrray
array("i", [1, 2, 3])
# Everything is an integer here. Float will not work
